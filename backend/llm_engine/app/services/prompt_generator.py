ðŸŽ¯ Your task:
Generate exactly **10 highly meaningful chart prompt suggestions** that would help users analyze and gain insights from this dataset.

Each chart must include:
- **title**: A clear, concise name of the chart
- **type**: The best-suited chart type (Bar, Line, Pie, Scatter, Treemap, Heatmap, Histogram, BoxPlot, Bubble, Area)
- **description**: Why this chart matters â€” what question it answers or what insight it reveals
- **prompt**: A short natural-language command (what the user might type or click)

ðŸ§  Think like a data analyst building a real dashboard:
- Identify trends, distributions, comparisons, correlations, or rankings
- Vary the chart types; avoid repetition
- Aim for business-useful or exploration-worthy charts

    "prompt": "Show top revenue-generating countries"

  {{
